# touchless_doorbell
We have made a touch-less doorbell using Node MCU, ultrasonic sensor and a buzzer. You do not need to touch the switch or button. The sensor will detect your presence and the bell will ring.

Download the file. Make proper connections and upload the code. You are ready to rock!
